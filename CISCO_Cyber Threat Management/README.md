## Governance

IT security governance determines who is authorized to make decisions about cybersecurity risks within an organization.

* **data owner**, ensures compliance with policies and procedures, assigns the proper classification to information assets, and determines the criteria for accessing information assets

* **data controller**, determines the purpose for which, and the way in which, personal data is processed

* **data processor**, processes data on behalf of the data controller

* **data custodian**, implements the classification and security controls for the data in accordance with the rules set out by the data owner

* **data steward**, ensures that the data supports an organization's business needs and meets regulatory requirements

* **data protection officer**, oversees an organization's data protection strategy

---

## Types of Security Policies

Every cybersecurity policy is a high-level document that outlines an organization's vision for cybersecurity, including its goals, needs, scope and responsibilities.

* **Identification and Authentication policy**, specifies who should be permitted access to network resources and what verification procedures are in place to facilitate this

* **Password policy**,

* **Acceptable use policy**, highlights a set of rules that determine access to and use of network resources

* **Remote access policy**, sets out how to remotely connect to an organization’s internal network and explains what information is remotely accessible

* **Network maintenance policy**, outlines procedures for updating an organization’s specified operating systems and end-user applications

* **Incident handling policy**

* **Data policy**, sets out measurable rules for processing data within an organization

* **Credential policy**

* **Organizational policy**, provides guidance for how work should be carried out in an organization

## Types of Scans

A vulnerability scanner assesses computers, computer systems ,networks or applications for weaknesses.

* **Network scanners**, probe hosts for open ports, enumerate information about users and groups and look for known vulnerabilities on the network

* **Application scanners**, access application source code to test an application

* **Web application scanners**, identify vulnerabilities in web apps

---

* **Intrusive scans**, try to exploit vulnerabilities and may even crash the target

* **Non-intrusive scans**, try not to cause harm to the target

---

* **Credentialed scan**, allow the scanner to harvest more information *(acts as a logged in user)*

* **Non-credentialed scan**, it's an outsider's point of view

---

## Security Automation

* **Security Information and Event Management [SIEM]**, uses log collectors to aggregate log data from sources. Logs can generate many events in a day, SIEM helps reducing the number of events.
  
  *"It identifies internal and external threats, monitors activity and resource usage, conducts compliance reporting for audits and supports incident response"*

* **Orchestration Automation and Response [SOAR]**, allows to collect data about security threats from various sources, and responds to low-level events without the human intervention.
  
  *"It manages threats and vulnerabilities, allows to Security incident response, and Security operations automation"*
